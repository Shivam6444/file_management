# file_management
Please See the tutorial_software.mov for the working of the software. 
Here's a short description:
The project was developed for a freelancing project to move files to specific folders. For Example, if there are multiple files named Name_12.jpg, Name_13.jpg, and Name1_14.jpg, then the program will take the delimiter through the GUI which is '_' in this case and make two directories: Name and Name1. The program will move the image files Name_12.jpg and Name_13.jpg to Name folder and Name1_14.jpg to Name1 folder.
